# Usage guide

[简体中文](zh/usage.md)

## Installation and first run

Running from source requires Python 3.10+ and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```bash
uv sync
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-...
uv run trans-novel --version
uv run trans-novel translate book.epub
```

The displayed version is generated from the repository's Git tags. Tagged builds show the
release version; development builds include their commit distance and hash.

Whenever the program starts, it checks for `config.yaml` in the current directory and creates a documented default file when it is missing. Review the model settings before starting a real translation.

## Inspect model routing

```bash
uv run trans-novel models list
uv run trans-novel models explain --operation review.fix
uv run trans-novel models check --for translate
```

These commands preview routes and check credentials locally without requests. Keep the three default tiers or select models independently through `llm.routes`. See [configuration](configuration.md#models-and-operation-routing) for explicit config/usage conversion, budgets and `models compare`.

## Multilingual translation (experimental)

Run `uv run trans-novel languages` to list built-in languages. Use this fragment in your configuration, retaining your existing model settings, for direct Chinese-to-English translation:

```yaml
language:
  source: zh
  target: en
```

```bash
uv run trans-novel --config config.yaml translate book.epub --bilingual
```

Outputs are `output/book.en.epub` and `output/book.en-bi.epub`. For Japanese-to-English use `source: ja`, `target: en`; for English-to-Japanese use `source: en`, `target: ja`. A reverse run takes a file in the corresponding source language; each run selects one direction. Explicit `--out` names and their `-bi` derivatives retain their existing behavior.

The `.zh.*` examples below describe the default Simplified Chinese target. All book targets use `state/<book>/targets/<target-language>/`; subtitles use `state/srt/<slug>/targets/<target-language>/`. Resume and standalone stages use the same target configuration; switching back does not retranslate completed work. The EPUB about page is Chinese for Simplified Chinese targets and otherwise temporarily falls back to an English page tagged as English; disable it with `about_page: false`.

The CLI uses English for help, progress, tables, and errors. Translation and generated descriptive metadata follow `language.target`; original names in `source` and `aliases` remain available for matching. Existing analysis and glossary notes are reused when resuming and are not automatically translated by this update. This version does not support RTL targets such as Arabic or Hebrew. PDF fonts and external bridge language capabilities require separate validation. Real-model long-form before/after quality evaluation remains outstanding.

## Windows

Windows releases provide `wenyi-windows-x64.zip`. Verify the archive against
`SHA256SUMS.txt` before running it.

When using a packaged `wenyi.exe`, set the API key in PowerShell:

```powershell
# Current PowerShell session only
$env:DEEPSEEK_API_KEY = "sk-..."
.\wenyi.exe translate .\book.epub
```

To save the environment variable permanently, run the following command and then open a new PowerShell window:

```powershell
setx DEEPSEEK_API_KEY "sk-..."
```

You may also set `language.source` to a known ISO language code to avoid an additional model call for language detection.

## Linux

Releases provide `wenyi-linux-x64.tar.gz` and `wenyi-linux-arm64.tar.gz`. Download
the archive matching your processor, verify it against `SHA256SUMS.txt`, and run:

```bash
tar -xzf wenyi-linux-arm64.tar.gz  # use wenyi-linux-x64.tar.gz on x64 systems
chmod +x wenyi
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-...
./wenyi translate book.epub
```

## macOS

Releases provide separate terminal executables for Apple Silicon (`wenyi-macos-arm64.tar.gz`)
and Intel (`wenyi-macos-x64.tar.gz`) Macs. Download the archive matching your processor,
verify it against `SHA256SUMS.txt`, and run:

```bash
tar -xzf wenyi-macos-arm64.tar.gz  # use wenyi-macos-x64.tar.gz on Intel Macs
chmod +x wenyi
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-...
./wenyi translate book.epub
```

These command-line executables are ad-hoc signed by PyInstaller but are not notarized with an
Apple Developer certificate. macOS may quarantine a downloaded build; after verifying the
checksum, approve it in **System Settings → Privacy & Security** if prompted.

## Input and output

- Input formats: EPUB, FB2, TXT, Markdown, HTML, PDF, DOCX, and SRT.
- Default book output: a monolingual `<book-name>.zh.epub` under the source file's `output/` directory (`.docx` inputs default to `<book-name>.zh.docx`, and BabelDOC PDF state defaults to `<book-name>.zh.pdf`). The bilingual `*.zh-bi.*` edition is optional.
- `--format epub|txt|html|markdown|pdf|docx`: export the selected format for book inputs. When omitted, BabelDOC PDF state → `pdf`, `.docx` → `docx`, and other books (including MinerU PDF state) → `epub`. An explicit format always takes precedence; PDF defaults follow the saved backend, even if the current `pdf_backend` setting has changed. This flag does not apply to SRT.
- For EPUB input, Wenyi attempts to write translated text back into the original XHTML templates while preserving styles, images, the table of contents, and anchors.
- The bilingual edition displays the translation and source text together. The source is visually subdued by default; set `output.bilingual_preserve_source_style: true` to inherit the book's normal text style. Their order is controlled by `output.bilingual_order`.
- EPUB output includes an “About this translation” page by default. Set `output.about_page: false` to disable it.
- Book runtime data is stored under `state/<book>/targets/<target-language>/`, including chapter intermediates, the SQLite glossary, usage data, and reports. Subtitle runs use a separate tree under `state/srt/` (see [SRT subtitles](#srt-subtitles)).

### Experimental PDF support

PDF input and PDF output are both experimental.

#### PDF input

Default backend is MinerU. For layout-preserving export, use the external
**BabelDOC bridge** (AGPL, separate repo/process, HTTP only):

1. Install/start `wenyi-babeldoc-bridge` (default `http://127.0.0.1:8765`)
2. In `config.yaml`:

```yaml
pipeline:
  pdf_backend: babeldoc
  babeldoc_bridge_url: http://127.0.0.1:8765
  # babeldoc_pages: "15"   # optional, 1-based
```

3. `translate book.pdf` automatically exports PDF through bridge `/fillback`. Later, `assemble book.pdf` also defaults to PDF for that saved BabelDOC state; `--format pdf` is optional. Use an explicit `--format` to select another format.
   The fillback PDF omits BabelDOC layout overlay boxes and role labels
   such as ``plain text`` / ``title`` by default.
   The bridge freezes the post-extraction IL as a durable session snapshot. It can
   restart and lazily restore the same session without rerunning layout analysis,
   provided its session directory and exact Python/BabelDOC versions are retained.
   Set `WENYI_BABELDOC_STATE_DIR` to a persistent directory for long translations;
   the default system temporary directory may be cleaned after a reboot. Wenyi never
   imports babeldoc. Chapters are split from the PDF outline (bookmarks); segments
   keep `meta.babeldoc_id` for fillback. Books without outlines fall back to one chapter.

BabelDOC is intended for PDFs with an extractable text layer. Before contacting the
bridge, Wenyi checks the selected pages and stops with a suggestion to use the default
MinerU backend or run OCR first when it finds only scanned images and no text layer.

The first MinerU PDF import requires `MINERU_API_KEY`:

```bash
export MINERU_API_KEY=...
uv run trans-novel translate book.pdf
```

MinerU's converted HTML is saved at
`state/<book>/targets/<target-language>/source/<source-sha256>/converted.html`. The content-addressed
directory prevents an interrupted run from reusing another PDF's conversion.
Later runs reuse this file, and you may correct it manually before resuming.

#### PDF output

WeasyPrint is the default PDF engine. Install its optional dependency and omit
`--pdf-engine`:

```bash
uv sync --extra pdf-output
uv run trans-novel assemble book.html --format pdf
```

For a lightweight cross-platform engine without system rendering libraries,
use `fpdf2`:

```bash
uv sync --extra pdf-output-lite
uv run trans-novel assemble book.html --format pdf --pdf-engine fpdf2
```

`fpdf2` supports basic layout and images, but only a limited HTML/CSS subset.
Images mixed with text are placed as separate blocks. It uses a discoverable
CJK system font; if none is found, set `TRANS_NOVEL_PDF_FONT` to a TTF, OTF, or
TTC font file. This option also works on Windows.

## DOCX (Word)

`translate book.docx` uses the full book Orchestrator (glossary, polish, review, resume under `state/<slug>/targets/<target-language>/`).

**Structure**

- Paragraphs and heading styles (`Heading 1`–`9` / outline levels); level-1 headings start chapters.
- Simple tables are rebuilt cell-by-cell (no merged cells / nested tables in v1).
- Word automatic lists (`numPr`) become List Number / List Bullet groups (restart per source list id).
- Contents-style lines that already include a visible prefix such as `1. Title` are **not** auto-numbered again (avoids double numbering).

**Styles**

- Keeps bold / italic / underline / color / size, paragraph alignment, and shading.
- Uniform runs: apply on export with **no** extra model call.
- Mixed runs: after translate, each meaningful span is positioned alone (EPUB-annotation-style markers); bold/color and other attrs are **inherited from the source item**. Failed spans fall back proportionally without discarding the whole paragraph.
- Font/size-only run splits are ignored for alignment (noise).
- Translated Chinese uses **Song (宋体)**; untranslated source text and bilingual source lines do **not** force Song.
- Default Heading theme blue is neutralized unless the source set an explicit color.

**Output**

- Default: `output/<stem>.zh.docx` (Navigation pane via heading outline). Override with `--format epub` (etc.).

```bash
uv run trans-novel translate book.docx
uv run trans-novel translate book.docx --bilingual
uv run trans-novel translate book.docx --format epub
```

## SRT subtitles

`translate` routes `.srt` files automatically. The subtitle path is intentionally
lighter than the book pipeline:

- sliding windows of 20 cues with overlap 10, up to 100 concurrent strong-tier calls;
- no glossary, polishing, or whole-book review;
- `--chapter`, `--polish`, `--review`, and `--format` are ignored or rejected where they do not apply;
- monolingual `output/<stem>.zh.srt` by default; add `--bilingual` for `.zh-bi.srt`.

```bash
uv run trans-novel translate movie.srt
uv run trans-novel translate movie.srt --bilingual
uv run trans-novel translate movie.srt --no-mono --bilingual
```

Resume by running the same source file again. Cached batches under
`state/srt/<slug>/targets/<target-language>/batches/` are skipped. Layout:

```text
state/srt/<slug>/targets/<target-language>/
  manifest.json    # source identity, cue counts, window settings
  cues.jsonl       # one cue per line: index, timestamp, source, target, status
  batches/         # raw model results for resume
  usage.json       # cumulative token usage across resumes
  timing.json      # cumulative execution time and individual invocation durations
  events.jsonl     # run events and LLM retry observations
```

There is no `glossary.db` or `reviews/` tree for subtitles. Package code lives in
`trans_novel.srt` (store + translate), with I/O in `ingest.srt_reader` and
`assemble.srt_writer`.

## Usage and event logs

Each target directory stores cumulative token usage in `usage.json` and appends stage events and retries to `events.jsonl`. Review directories also record session usage; each increment is merged into the cumulative ledger once.

The progress-bar clock measures the entire current workflow, including parsing, model
waits, translation, polishing, review and export. Switching stages, chapters or review
rounds does not reset it; completing one stage does not stop it while subsequent work
is pending. Concurrent model requests contribute wall time, not the sum of request durations.

After `prepare`, `translate` (including `--chapter` and SRT), `review` or `assemble`,
the CLI prints the last run's duration and cumulative execution time. Each target's
`timing.json` stores `total_seconds` and a `runs` list with invocation IDs, operations,
timestamps, durations and completion statuses. Repeating a command adds only that
invocation's execution time, excluding downtime between runs; nested pipeline stages
are counted once. Separately launched commands contribute their own durations, even
when they overlap. Book timing can also be inspected with `trans-novel status book.epub`;
inspection and report regeneration do not add time.

Once book state has been initialized or validated, failures and normal Ctrl+C exits
also save the invocation's elapsed time. Timing is committed atomically under its own
lock, independently of token usage. Older runs have no timing history to recover;
time is accumulated from this version onward. A forced kill or a failure before state
initialization cannot save the current invocation's duration.

Manifests bind input content with `source_sha256`. A different file with the same name, or state without a valid hash, cannot resume; create new translation state.

## Common commands

```bash
# Run the complete workflow, translate one chapter, or prepare without translating
uv run trans-novel translate book.epub
uv run trans-novel translate book.epub --chapter 3
uv run trans-novel translate book.epub --format txt
uv run trans-novel prepare book.epub
uv run trans-novel translate book.pdf
uv run trans-novel translate movie.srt

# Override polishing and final review settings
uv run trans-novel translate book.epub --polish --review
uv run trans-novel translate book.epub --no-polish --no-review

# Produce both editions, or only the bilingual edition
uv run trans-novel translate book.epub --bilingual
uv run trans-novel translate book.epub --no-mono --bilingual
```

`prepare` parses the book, detects its language, generates the style guide and initial glossary, and completes the configured whole-book prescan without translating any body text. Run `translate` with the same source file to continue from the saved state.

## Interrupting and resuming

Every completed batch is written to the state directory. To resume after an interruption, run the same source file again:

```bash
uv run trans-novel translate book.epub
uv run trans-novel status book.epub
```

Changing polishing settings does not automatically rerun translation batches that
are already complete. Review can reuse a completed result or resume an interrupted
run marked `running` or `interrupted` when translation content, review configuration, and glossary
fingerprints match. A run marked `failed` starts a new review rather than resuming
its checkpoint. Recoverable provider failures, such as quota, timeout, and transport
errors, are recorded as `interrupted`; exhausted review output recovery remains a failure.
Runs are read-only by default; `--autofix` may publish their final revisions.

If the initial Reviewer response reaches the token limit, review recursively splits
the affected block and retries smaller blocks. Single-paragraph failures use the
bounded `pipeline.review_output_retries` allowance; exhaustion stops the workflow
with an error, never a clean-review result. Truncated responses are not accepted as
complete output. Recovery may require extra model calls and smaller review contexts.
Use a new state directory or remove the corresponding state only when you
intentionally want a fresh translation.

## Independent stages and glossary management

```bash
uv run trans-novel review book.epub
uv run trans-novel review book.epub --autofix
uv run trans-novel glossary list book.epub
uv run trans-novel glossary conflicts book.epub
uv run trans-novel glossary resolve book.epub "source term" "chosen translation"
uv run trans-novel report book.epub
uv run trans-novel assemble book.epub
```

`review` checks the complete translated book using the final glossary. Its
unchanged initial Reviewer runs over contiguous chunks concurrently; candidates
can then enter a bounded evidence loop, and contradictory cross-chunk consistency
suggestions can receive a final recommendation. Confirmed issues may generate
provisional full-segment replacements in a run-local shadow translation. Every
Fixer in a round reads the same immutable snapshot; the next whole-book pass
blindly reviews the resulting shadow text without receiving prior issue
explanations. By default these replacements remain read-only. With `--autofix`
(or `pipeline.review_autofix: true`), folded `changes` are applied first; remaining
issues then reuse the same bounded Review Agent Loop against that updated text,
and confirmed issues reuse the same Review Fixer. The final complete segments are
written only to chapter `target`; no Review history fields are added to chapter
JSON, and the manifest and glossary are unchanged. Each run writes one user-facing
`result.json`, its model-usage
delta, an event stream, and internal round traces to
`state/<book>/targets/<target-language>/reviews/review-<timestamp>/`. The same usage delta is also added once
to the book's cumulative `usage.json`. Autofix keeps its full before/after chain,
issue decisions, failures, and idempotent write journal in `autofix/index.json`;
annotation and DOCX style offsets are refreshed after publishing. `report.json`
contains a compact Review and Autofix summary.

`report` summarizes the current translation and latest Review result without
modifying translated text. `assemble` rebuilds output from existing state without
calling the model again. If another terminal is still translating, export uses a
consistent snapshot of the batches already persisted when the command starts; run
it again to include batches completed afterward.
